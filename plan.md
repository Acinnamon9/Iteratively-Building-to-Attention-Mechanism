Good. You’re starting with the right mindset.

### Prerequisites

Before you write any code, make sure you understand these **four core components**:

1. **Dot product and matrix multiplication** – via NumPy.
2. **Softmax function** – what it does and why it's used for weighting.
3. **Vector normalization and scaling** – especially in dot-product attention.
4. **Basic linear transformations** – how matrices can project vectors into different spaces.

### Step-by-step Strategy to Build Attention Mechanism

#### Step 1: Implement Core Math Utilities

Functions:

* `dot_product(a, b)`
* `matmul(A, B)`
* `softmax(x, axis=-1)`
* `scale(x, factor)`

Your goal: Reimplement (or wrap) NumPy’s versions, so you control and understand the operations.

---

#### Step 2: Scaled Dot-Product Attention (Single Head)

Inputs:

* Query `Q`: shape `(seq_len, d_k)`
* Key `K`: shape `(seq_len, d_k)`
* Value `V`: shape `(seq_len, d_v)`

Functions:

* `attention(Q, K, V)`: implement this formula:

  $$
  \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
  $$

Make it work for:

* A single query.
* A batch of queries.

Test it with small input tensors (manually constructed).

---

#### Step 3: Add Masking Support

Useful for:

* Preventing attention to future tokens (causal masking).
* Ignoring padding tokens.

Function:

* Modify `attention(Q, K, V, mask=None)`

---

#### Step 4: Multi-Head Attention

Concept:

* Project Q, K, V to multiple lower-dimensional spaces.
* Apply attention in each head separately.
* Concatenate and project output.

Functions:

* `split_heads(Q, num_heads)`
* `combine_heads(heads)`
* `multihead_attention(Q, K, V, num_heads, W_q, W_k, W_v, W_o)`

You’ll now need to implement linear projections with weight matrices.

---

#### Step 5: Package as a Class

Wrap the entire thing in a Python class: `MultiHeadAttention`.

Include:

* Initialization of weight matrices.
* Forward function taking Q, K, V.

---

#### Step 6: Validate with Real Inputs

Use toy sequences (e.g., embedding vectors of fake tokens) and verify outputs match expected shapes and properties (e.g., attention weights sum to 1).

---

#### Step 7: (Optional) Compare with PyTorch

Reimplement using PyTorch tensors, compare results with `nn.MultiheadAttention`.

Challenge:
Implement Step 1 now — write a `softmax` function from scratch and test it against NumPy’s version. Show your output. Then move to the next step.
